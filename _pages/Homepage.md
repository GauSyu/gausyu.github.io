*<font size="5">Hi! This is Xu Gao</font>* <font size="5">(高煦；Gau-Syu)</font>

I'm a math postdoc at Tongji University.

I have a wide range of interests in mathematics: $p$-adic geometry, representation theory, vertex operator algebras and conformal field theory, $D$-modules and algebraic analysis, tensor triangular geometry, higher category theory and homotopical algebras, complex algebraic geometry and transcendental number theory, etc. 

Before joining Tongji University, I completed my Ph.D. at UC Santa Cruz in June 2023. 
During my time at Santa Cruz, I studied vertex operator algebras and chiral algebras under the supervision of [Chongying Dong](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=dong), and algebraic geometry and number theory under the supervision of [Junecue Suh](https://www.math.ucsc.edu/people/faculty.php?uid=jusuh).

Before moving to UCSC, I received my master degree at [Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/) under the advice of [Chengming Bai](http://en.cim.nankai.edu.cn/info/1142/1295.htm), studying pre-Lie algebras and Rota-Baxter operators.
