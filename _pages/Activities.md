		<blockquote>
  	$p$-adic representations are important objects in number theory, and stable lattices serve as a connection between the study of ordinary and modular representations. These stable lattices can be understood as stable vertices in Bruhat-Tits buildings. From this viewpoint, the study of fixed point sets in these buildings can aid research on -adic representations. The simplicial balls, in particular, hold an important role as they possess the most symmetry and fastest growth, and are closely related to the Moy-Prasad filtrations. In this talk, I will introduce some results on simplicial balls.

The simplicial distance holds an important role as it connects the combinatorics of lattices and the geometry of root systems. In particularly, the fixed-point sets of Moy-Prasad subgroups are precisely the simplicial balls. In this talk, I'll explain those findings and compute their simplicial volume under certain conditions.
